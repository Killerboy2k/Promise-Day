                <br>
                <br>
                But wait, before anyone thinks that it's a love story. Lemme make it clear. It's Much more than that.
                It's a story of how 2 strangers, who were totally different from each other and had completely different problems in life. They came together,and helped each other become better version of themselves. <br>
                It all started from everyday texting and weekend meetups. From there, we are here now. Calling each other Life Partners - Wify-Husby.
                <br>
                Never expected To reach here, right?
                Khushbu!
                You made me what I am today. Thats for Everything. Hope this Gift brings a smile to your face. Love you meri jaan! 
                <br><br>
                You have been family to me. Supported me in every situation in my life.The way you say No, Not allowed, Nope makes me feel more connected to you my crazy girl !
